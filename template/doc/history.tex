\chapter{History}

The naming scheme of versions is as follows: KOMA-Script version followed by the template version. Version 3.2.0 is thus
a huge change from 3.1.0 with both compatible for version 3 of KOMA-script.

\minisec{2006/06 v2.0.0}
Initial online release of the template. It is based on KOMA-Script 2.x,
supports most modern packages (at year 2006), provides most package options in the code
and a documentation of the preamble code. The basic language is German.
Additionally it provides a demo file for testing and showing the document layout.
%
\minisec{2008/12 v3.1.0} %
New release due to a rework for KOMA-Script 3.x. 
The basic design was adopted from the previous version.
Further changes mainly in terms of package updates and bug fixes.

\item Focus on a target group of user who want to write thesis like documents.
\item Introduction of a template documentation.
