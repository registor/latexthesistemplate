% Package imakeidx tests for \directlua and finds it defined, because it uses 
% eTeX's \ifdefined, however pgfplots redefines it to \relax. That causes
% an error in imakeidx.
% this is a workaround to make it work again. 
% However, this must be fixed in pgfplots, since it is a bug in that package.
